Developed a web scraper using Selenium to automate the extraction of property listings from a dynamic real estate website. The tool navigates through multiple pages, scrapes property details (title, price, location, bedrooms), and handles user interactions like clicks and pop-ups. Data is cleaned and saved into a structured CSV file for analysis.
